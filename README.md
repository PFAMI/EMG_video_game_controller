# EMG Video Game Controller

A Jupyter Notebook (Python script) that reads EMG signals from the Backyard Brains SpikerBox in real time, computes the RMS envelope, and triggers keyboard events when EMG activity exceeds a customizable threshold. The system also provides real-time visualization of EMG activity, enabling to monitor signal quality and see when a keypress is generated.

## Features
- Real-time EMG acquisition from Backyard Brains SpikerBox  
- Filtering+RMS envelope computation for muscle activity detection  
- **Customizable EMG threshold** for keypress triggering  
- **Adaptable keyboard output**: choose any key to map (e.g., game shortcuts)  
- **Serial port configuration**: specify correct COM port  
- **Live visualization**: EMG activity plot with markers for keypresses  


## Installation

1. Download the script (https://github.com/PFAMI/EMG_video_game_controller.git : EMG_controlling_Keyboard.ipynb)
2. Install dependencies: pip install numpy matplotlib pyserial pyautogui
3. Connect your Backyard Brains Human SpikerBox as instructed by BackyardBrains and identify the correct COM port.

## Usage

Run the Jupyter Notebook or script: jupyter notebook EMG_controller.ipynb

During execution, a pop-up window will display a real-time plot of EMG activity. Keypresses generated by threshold crossings are marked on the plot.

You can open a word processor to verify that the script generates an output correctly, before to start your video-game.

## Example
* In World of Warcraft, you can bind the script’s output key to a spell shortcut, for instance to the one-click rotations assistant triggered by EMG activity
* More generally, any video game or application that responds to keyboard input can be controlled with EMG signals through this system.

## Customization
- Adjust EMG threshold in the script with « threshold = 200 »
- Change the output key (e.g., spacebar, number keys) with « key = 'a' »
- Define plotting parameters or disable visualization as needed.

## Notes
- Tested with Backyard Brains Human SpikerBox hardware, Windows 11, Python v3., pandas v….. 
- Performance and latency depend on system configuration and game input handling.
